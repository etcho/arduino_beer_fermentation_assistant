# arduino_beer_fermentation_assistant
A code for keeping a freezer at the desireable temperature during all the proccess of fermentation when crafting beer.

The code is fully operating and already helped producing several batches of beer!

It allows you to set temperature steps, changing the temperature gradually during the fermentation's days. It has a Real Time Clock, prevent failure due energy cuts, since the proccess takes over 20 days, usually. To interact, there are 4 push buttons and a 16x4 lcd display that informs the current temperature and the number of running days, and the configuration menu, of course. All the settings are saved on the arduino's EEPROM.
